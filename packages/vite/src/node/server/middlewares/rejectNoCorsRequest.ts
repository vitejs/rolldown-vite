/**
 * A middleware that rejects no-cors mode requests that are not same-origin.
 *
 * We should avoid untrusted sites to load the script to avoid attacks like GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v.
 * This is because:
 * - the path of HMR patch files / entry point files can be predictable
 * - the HMR patch files may not include ESM syntax
 *   (if they include ESM syntax, loading as a classic script would fail)
 * - the HMR runtime in the browser has the list of all loaded modules
